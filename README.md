# New-Calculator
Just like any other regular calculator, nah, better than those regular one's + you can get the source code of this one and understand how Calculators are made.

This is what makes it better: 
(1)You can get -0 on iOS calculator (Tap on +/- button when you see 0 on screen). Now what is -0? In this one you shall not. 
(2)I have implemented the strategy of % operator better than the iOS calculator.
(3)iOS calculator does not allow you 999,999,999 + 1. Well iCalPlus does allow you to get that done. Infact even 999,999,999,999 + 1 & even more :) 

Intended Audience: 
(1)Who are relativiely new to Objective-C.
(2)New to programming.
(3)Who intend to build a calculator.
(4)Who want to understand how a calculator works. 

Play around! Please open an issue if you find any bug or want a feature enhancement. Cheers!
