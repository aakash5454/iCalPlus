# iCalPlus
Its Just like any other regular calculator? nah, better than those regular one's + you can also get the source    code of this one and know how Calculators Apps are made.

Now this is what makes this one better: 
(1)You cannot get -0 on this calculator. (Tap on +/- button when you see 0 on screen in current iOS 8 calculator    and see). Now what is -0? In this one you shall not.  
(2)I have implemented the strategy of % operator better than the iOS calculator. This suits me, hope it does to you too. 
(3)iOS calculator does not allow you 999,999,999 + 1 in potrait mode. Well iCalPlus does allow you to get that done in potrait mode. Infact even 999,999,999,999 + 1 & even more :) 

Intended Audience: 
(1)Who are relativiely new to Objective-C.
(2)New to programming.
(3)Who intend to build a calculator.
(4)Who want to understand how a calculator works. 
(5)People learning to code, can use this as reference. 

Play around! Please OPEN an issue if you find any bug or want a feature enhancement, or have any question. Cheers! #star.
