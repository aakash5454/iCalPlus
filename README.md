# New-Calculator
Just like any other regular calculator, but hey! you can get the source code and understand 
how Calculators are made.

Also this one is better than the one you get in iphone in many ways as:
(1)You can get -0 on iphone calculator (Tap on +/- button when you see 0 on screen). Now what is -0?
(2)I have implemented the strategy of % operator better than the iphone calculator.

Intended Audience: 
(1)Who are relativiely new to Objective-C.
(2)New to programming.
(3)Who intend to build a calculator.
(4)Who want to understand how a calculator works. 

Play around! Please open an issue if you find any bug or want a feature enhancement. Cheers!
